# About this submission

I've finished basically all of the functionality and wrote one test using React Testing Lib. If this were a real world app, I would want to write more tests, especially some integration tests, but this test checks the basic rendering functionality of the app. I implemented my standard process of handling CSS, using SCSS and a methodology for working with the cascade rather than against it.

I meant to make this multiple PRs to a git repo, but I didn't end up doing that - I'm going to make one PR and leave some comments on that as well.
